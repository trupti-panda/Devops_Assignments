Task -13
Create a vpc with 9 subnets(6 private and 3 public). 3 types application, database and loadbalncer

Task14
Create RDS with mysql and choose the private db subnets for the same. Create one EC2 instance then install and configure the wordpress, generate an image out of it.
Note:  your code should dynamically pick the rds dns and it should inject to ec2 on image creation.

Better to create one more subnet called Jump subnet and make it as public

Ensure you are managing the security groups accordingly
